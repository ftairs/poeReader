# Edgar Allen Poe Reader - Version 2#

I made this for all the fellow lovers of Poe. There will be a larger compilation coming really soon.

If you don't want to do the download thing just go to [the hosted version.](http://www.victorpfuentes.com/poereader/)

Built it on [HTML5BP](http://html5boilerplate.com/) and [Simplegrid](https://github.com/ThisIsDallas/Simple-Grid). Used the wonderful [FontAwesome](http://fontawesome.io/) icon set.

####*Update*
Version 2 is a big change. The page changes work basically the same but the whole front-end is remade. It also now includes Volume 2, the main reason for the update. From now on updates of stories will be quick and easy.

### Licensing ###

This is all free use. It's so old it falls into public domain, so I can't claim it, you can't claim it and it's for sharing not selling. Let's all just enjoy it.

As for anything I wrote. Tear it apart, learn from it or just let it do it's thing and read it. Doesn't matter to me. Consider a WTF license.
