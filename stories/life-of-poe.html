    <p>
        Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,
    </p>
    <p>
        Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore--<br>
        While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,
    </p>
    <p>
        As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.<br>
        "'Tis some visiter," I muttered, "tapping at my chamber door--
    </p>
    <p>
        Only this and nothing more."
    </p>
    <p>
        Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December,<br>
        And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
        Eagerly I wished the morrow;--vainly I had sought to borrow
    </p>
    <p>
        From my books surcease of sorrow--sorrow for the lost Lenore--
    </p>
    <p>
        For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore--
    </p>
    <p>
        Nameless here for evermore.
    </p>
    <p>
        And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain
    </p>
    <p>
        Thrilled me--filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;
    </p>
    <p>
        So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating
    </p>
    <p>
        "'Tis some visiter entreating entrance at my chamber door--
    </p>
    <p>
        Some late visiter entreating entrance at my chamber door;
    </p>
    <p>
        This it is and nothing more."
    </p>
    <p>
        Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,
    </p>
    <p>
        "Sir," said I, "or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;
    </p>
    <p>
        But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,
    </p>
    <p>
        And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,
    </p>
    <p>
        That I scarce was sure I heard you"--here I opened wide the door--
    </p>
    <p>
        Darkness there and nothing more.
    </p>
    <p>
        Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,
    </p>
    <p>
        Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortals ever dared to dream before;
    </p>
    <p>
        But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,
    </p>
    <p>
        And the only word there spoken was the whispered word,
    </p>
    <p>
        "Lenore?" This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word,
    </p>
    <p>
        "Lenore!"--
    </p>
    <p>
        Merely this and nothing more.
    </p>
    <p>
        Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,
    </p>
    <p>
        Soon again I heard a tapping something louder than before.<br>
        "Surely," said I, "surely that is something at my window lattice;
    </p>
    <p>
        Let me see, then, what thereat is and this mystery explore--
    </p>
    <p>
        Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;--
    </p>
    <p>
        'Tis the wind and nothing more.
    </p>
    <p>
        Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,
    </p>
    <p>
        In there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore.
    </p>
    <p>
        Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he,
    </p>
    <p>
        But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door--
    </p>
    <p>
        Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door--
    </p>
    <p>
        Perched, and sat, and nothing more.
    </p>
    <p>
        Then the ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,<br>
        By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,<br>
        "Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou," I said, "art sure no craven,
    </p>
    <p>
        Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore--
    </p>
    <p>
        Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore!"
    </p>
    <p>
        Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."
    </p>
    <p>
        Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,
    </p>
    <p>
        Though its answer little meaning--little relevancy bore;<br>
        For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being<br>
        Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door--
    </p>
    <p>
        Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,
    </p>
    <p>
        With such name as "Nevermore."
    </p>
    <p>
        But the Raven, sitting lonely on that placid bust, spoke only
    </p>
    <p>
        That one word, as if its soul in that one word he did outpour
    </p>
    <p>
        Nothing farther then he uttered; not a feather then he fluttered--
    </p>
    <p>
        Till I scarcely more than muttered: "Other friends have flown before--
    </p>
    <p>
        On the morrow he will leave me, as my Hopes have flown before."
    </p>
    <p>
        Then the bird said "Nevermore."
    </p>
    <p>
        Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,<br>
        "Doubtless," said I, "what it utters is its only stock and store,
    </p>
    <p>
        Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster<br>
        Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore--
    </p>
    <p>
        Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore
    </p>
    <p>
        Of 'Never--nevermore.'"
    </p>
    <p>
        But the Raven still beguiling all my sad soul into smiling,
    </p>
    <p>
        Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird and bust and door;
    </p>
    <p>
        Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking<br>
        Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore--
    </p>
    <p>
        What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore
    </p>
    <p>
        Meant in croaking "Nevermore."
    </p>
    <p>
        This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing<br>
        To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's core;
    </p>
    <p>
        This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining
    </p>
    <p>
        On the cushion's velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o'er,
    </p>
    <p>
        But whose velvet violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o'er
    </p>
    <p>
        She shall press, ah, nevermore!
    </p>
    <p>
        Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer
    </p>
    <p>
        Swung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.
    </p>
    <p>
        "Wretch," I cried, "thy God hath lent thee--by these angels he hath sent thee
    </p>
    <p>
        Respite--respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore!<br>
        Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!"
    </p>
    <p>
        Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."
    </p>
    <p>
        "Prophet!" said I, "thing of evil!--prophet still, if bird or devil!--
    </p>
    <p>
        Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,
    </p>
    <p>
        Desolate, yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted--
    </p>
    <p>
        On this home by Horror haunted--tell me truly, I implore--<br>
        Is there--is there balm in Gilead?--tell me--tell me, I implore!"
    </p>
    <p>
        Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."
    </p>
    <p>
        "Prophet!" said I, "thing of evil!--prophet still, if bird or devil!
    </p>
    <p>
        By that Heaven that bends above us--by that God we both adore--
    </p>
    <p>
        Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,
    </p>
    <p>
        It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore--
    </p>
    <p>
        Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore."
    </p>
    <p>
        Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."
    </p>
    <p>
        "Be that our sign of parting, bird or fiend!" I shrieked, upstarting--
    </p>
    <p>
        "Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's Plutonian shore!
    </p>
    <p>
        Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul has spoken!
    </p>
    <p>
        Leave my loneliness unbroken!--quit the bust above my door!
    </p>
    <p>
        Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!"
    </p>
    <p>
        Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."
    </p>
    <p>
        And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting
    </p>
    <p>
        On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;<br>
        And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming
    </p>
    <p>
        And the lamp-light o'er him streaming throws his shadows on the floor;
    </p>
    <p>
        And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor
    </p>
    <div class="ending">
        <p>
            Shall be lifted--nevermore!
        </p>
            </div>
